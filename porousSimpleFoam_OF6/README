1. Clean the tutorials
$foamCleanPolyMesh
$foamCleanTutorials

 
2. Meshing 
$blockMesh


3.Create porous cellzone
$topoSet


4.run the solver 
$porousSimpleFoam > log.porousSimpleFoam &


5. To see the running script
$tail -f log.porousSimpleFoam


6. To calculate the pressure drop for porous medium, go to postProcessing folder/probe_number_1/0/p, and find the difference between probe 0 and probe 1 for the last probe time.
